/*
 Resolving a method call with method implementation is known as Binding.
 or,
 Deciding or resolving method calls to its implementation is known as Binding.
 
 There are two types of Binding..
 1. Early Binding or Static Binding or Compile time Binding
 2. Late Binding or Dynamic binding or Dynamic method Dispatch or Runtime Binding.
 
 	***********************************************************************************************************
 								
 1> In early binding ,method call is binded at compile time. i.e.; Compiler is deciding at compile time.
 
 	But in Late binding, method call is binded at runtime based on instance type.
 	i.e.; JRE is deciding at runtime.
 	
 2> For static, private, final methods early binding takes place at compile time.
 	
 	But for all data members (like- non-static, non-final, non-private methods) late binding takes place.
 	
 3> If the method is final,
 							then early binding takes place because same implimentation is available 
 							in all class thats why.

 4> If the method is static, 
 							then early binding takes place. Because static method is called during compile time
 							If we do late binding then it simply a time wasting.
 							
 5> Early binding is time saving, beacuse it happens during compile time, but output will not get as expected.
 	But to get proper output late binding is better.
 	
 6> Late binding is required whenever overriding is required. But not everytime.
 	For those method which are not overriden there late binding is not happening.
 	i.e.; for Overriden method, always Late Binding takes place.
 	
 	** Overriden method call is executed according to the instance type, not according to the ref. var type. 
 
 
 
 	(Q). Which of the following is incorrect?
	-->
		X: instance methods use dynamic (late) binding.
		Y: static methods use static (early) binding.
	Ans:- Both are correct.
