	 						************** INHERITANCE ***************
	 						
	 1) Process of acquiring all the properties from one type to another type is called Inheritance.
	 
	 2) Class from which properties are acquired is known as Base class or Super class.
	 
	 3) Class to which all the properties are acquired is known as Sub class or derived class.
	 
	 4) Java provides a keyword called 'extends' for inheritance.
	 
	 5) Sub class extends super class but not its vice versa.
	 
	 6) One sub class extending more than one super class is known as Multiple Inheritance.
	 
	 7) In Java, Multiple inheritance is not possible.
	 
	 ** super is a keyword which is used to refer super class members.
	 
	 
	 ** What are the things which can not inherited?
	 --> 1. private members
	 	 2. Static members
	 	 3. Construcors
	 	 4. Blocks
	 
	 ** Advantages:
	 --> 1. Code reusability.
	 	 2. Enhancement will be easy. (to upgrade some features in java will be easy)
	 	 3. Polymorphism
	 	 4. Abstraction
	 	 5. Loose Coupling.
	 	 
	 Q.) Is it possible for an interface to extends more than one interface in Java?
	 Ans: Yes, an interface can extend more than one interface in Java. 
		  For example: java.uti.List interface extends both Collection and iterable interface.
		 
		 
	 Q.) Is it possible for a class to implement more than one class in Java?
	 Ans: No, a class can only extend one class in Java.
 		  Though every class also, by default extend the java.lang.Object class in Java.
 		  
 		  
 	 Q.) Is it possible for a class to implement more than one interface in Java?
	 Ans: Yes. It is possible for a class to implement more than one interface. 
          For example, A class can implement Comparable and Serializable at the same time.
          
          
     Q.)  What will be the order of invocation of constructor in a class?
	 Ans: From subclass to superclass.
	 
	    
	 Q.)  What will be the order of constructor processing in a class?
	 Ans: From superclass to subclass.
