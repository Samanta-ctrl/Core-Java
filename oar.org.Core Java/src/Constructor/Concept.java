(Q.) What are the Rules for defining a constructor?
-->	
	 1) Constructor is a special type of method, which executes each time when 
	 	an instance is created by using new keyword.
	 	
	 2) Constructor name is always same as class name.
	 
	 3) Constructor has no return type.
	 
	 4) It can have all Access Modifiers are allowed (private , public, protected, default).
	 
	 5) Constructor without argument is called default constructor.
	 
	 6) If a class doesn't have any constructor, then implicitly java adds default constructor.
	 
	 7) Constructor with arguments/parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
	 
	 8) Whenever we created a new object then by default a constructor is created.
	 
	 9) Constructor is used to initialize the object.
	 
	 10) It Cannot have any Non Access Modifiers (final ,static, abstract, synchronized).
	 
	 11) It can take any number of parameters.

(Q.) Copy Constructor:
  -->
  		A constructor which copies all property values of a given object to a new object.
  		
  	It is used to construct an object by coping the state of another object within the same class.
  	Java doesn't provide copy constructor by default.
