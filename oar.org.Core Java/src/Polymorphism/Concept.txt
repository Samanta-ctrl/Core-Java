One entity showing  a behavior of different entity is known as Polymorphism.
 	
 	Example- 	A person at the same time can have different characteristic. 
 			Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
 	 		So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. 
 	 		This is called polymorphism.
 	 		
 	Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.
 	Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 
 	In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
 	The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.
 	
 	There are two types of polymorphism...
 		1> Compile time polymorphism.
 		2> Runtime polymorphism.
 		
 	# Compile time Polymorphism:-
 	--> 	Call to the overloaded method is resolved at the Compile time ,according to the argument type
 		is known as Compile time polymorphism.
 		
 		** Overloading is used to achieved the compile time polymorphism.
 	
 	#Run Time Polymorphism:-
 	-->		Call to the overriding method is resolved at the run time ,according the instance type 
 		is knwon as Run time polymorphism.
 		
 		** Overriding is used to achieved the run time polymorphism.
